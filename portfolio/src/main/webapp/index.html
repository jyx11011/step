      <h1>My Portfolio - Jiang Yuxin</h1>
      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Yuxin. I’m a second year Computer Science student in NUS. In my free time, I love traveling, exploring food from different cultures and cooking. I also love watching TV series and movies.
         My favourite sci-fic series is Black Mirror! I am really excited to join Google as an intern this year and I am looking forward to getting to know you!</p>
